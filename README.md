phalanx
=======

A starter app with Phalcon and Angular.

This is basically for my personal use but feel free to grab it for yourself, although I doubt you'll find it useful.

###Installation
Clone, run "php composer.phar install" in the root of the folder, import SQL file from _projectfiles/database and you're good to go. Naturally, change credentials in app/config/config.php to match yours.

###License
Don't be an asshole.

###Contributing
Taking pull requests so just throw them at me.
